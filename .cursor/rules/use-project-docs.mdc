# Use Project Docs

When editing, adding features, or answering questions about this project:

1. **AGENTS.md** – Read for project overview, entry points, component flow, and data flow. Use it to understand how parts connect and where to add new code.

2. **RULE.md** – Read for file- and folder-specific rules. Follow its guidelines when editing core/, ai/, market/, notifications/, or root files.

3. **When to reference** – Before making edits, adding modules, or changing imports. When unsure about structure, paths, or conventions.
